    Share your thoughts with friends and family....<br>
    Expressing our goals openly with friends and family holds profound significance,<br>
    a truth I genuinely endorse. Let me share a personal anecdote:<br>
    A rigorous year dedicated to preparing for JEE ADVANCE ended with an unexpected<br>
    twistâ€”missing out on just two marks in mathematics. Witnessing my JEE results momentarily <br>
    halted my heartbeat,ushering in a wave of regret for every second invested in preparation.<br>
    However, the narrative took a transformative turn upon joining my current college. By <br>
    candidly discussing life, college choices,and more with a senior, my entire perspective shifted. <br>
    This conversation not only alleviated regrets but also kindled a deep appreciation for my college.<br>
    Reflecting on my journey,I find no remorse in the JEE ADVANCE setback. <br>
    This experience reinforces the powerful impact of sharing one's sentiments, a practice that continues<br>
    to be a guiding light in navigating life's twists and turns.</p>
